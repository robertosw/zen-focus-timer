# Zen Timer

A timer meant to be used on your second monitor to block distractions (e.g. notifications) while you focus.


## Functionality

Select a duration using the mouse wheel. After starting the timer, only the longest part of the duration will be visible. The buttons are only visible if the mouse is inside the window.

**Example:**
Starting a timer for 1 minutes and 15 seconds will only display the minutes until there is less than one minute remaining:
